    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Thieboudienne is the national dish of Senegal, an aromatic combination of
      fish, vegetables, and rice in a hearty tomato sauce flavored with garlic
      and chili. Fish, vegetables, and rice are usually served separately, with
      a few lime wedges on the side, used for squeezing the juice over fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is believed that the dish was invented in the city of St. Louis in the
      19th century.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Marinating the Fish</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        With a mortar and pistol or in a food processor, grind the parsley,
        garlic, scotch bonnet, bullion black pepper and salt into a rough paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Poke two holes into the flesh of the fish and stuff them with the
        parsley mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil or Fry the fish until it is golden brown on each side, and set
        aside for the sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How to cook the rice</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a mortar and with a pestle or in a food processor grind the scotch
        bonnet peppers and garlic into a rough paste)
      </li>
      <li>
        Saute the sliced onions in the oil over medium heat until translucent
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the tomato paste, and stir fry for 5 minutes. The tomato paste
        may start to brown a little.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the ground garlic and scotch bonnet and stir fry for another 2
        minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the tough vegetable first in to the sauce and cook until tender.
        In this case, add in the sweet potatoes, cook until tender and remove,
        then the carrots, cook until tender and remove. Continue adding in the
        vegetables until all the vegetables are cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the cooked vegetables aside and then add in the fish and cook in the
        sauce for 2-5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the fish has simmered in the sauce for 2-5 minutes, gently remove
        it from the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point, drain the rice that has been cooking and pour into the
        sauce. The sauce should just cover the rice. Adjust the amount of water
        at this stage if needed to make sure that the rice is just covered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pot and simmer on low-medium heat for 15-20 minutes. You may
        seal the cover of the pot with foil to prevent steam from escaping.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the 15 minute mark, check that the rice has absorbed the moisture and
        is soft. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes if it needs more time. If
        the water has dried up and the rice is still not soft, add in 4 tbsp of
        water, cover and allow to cook.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot with the vegetables and fish, and lime wedges</li>
    </ol>
